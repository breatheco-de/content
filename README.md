# Content

## Types of content:

This list of contents is just a draft, some can be deleted or more can be added.

  1. Lessons: Long articles explaining big concepts like: HTML, JS Events, CSS Selectors, etc.
  2. Error: Explanation of a particular error that typically occurs when coding, for example: "Cannot do map of undefined".
  3. How To: Small articles/videos on different shot how to's, like: How to start a new react.js project.

##  Tagging content:

Contents can be tagged on the header of the markdown file; you can add as many tags as you want and later people will be able to search by tag.

There are two types of tags: Technology and Category.

## Command Line Interface:

A small command-line tool has been developed to help manage the lessons.

```
$ node ./src/utils/cli.js update_lesson --slug all --statusTo draft --statusFrom null
$ node ./src/utils/cli.js update_lesson --slug learn-html --statusTo draft --statusFrom null
$ node ./src/utils/cli.js download_images --slug python-syntax --type external_images
$ node ./src/utils/cli.js localize_images --slug python-syntax --type external_images
$ node ./src/utils/cli.js sanitize_lesson --slug all
```
