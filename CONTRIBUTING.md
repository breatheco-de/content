[Here you will find all the articles inside the repository](https://github.com/breatheco-de/content/tree/docs/src/content), some of them are:
- Published: already finished but you can still make small changes like fixing grammar errors.
- Draft: someone is already working on it but it's not finished yet.
- Unassigned: no one has picked that article or started working on it.
- Pending translation: there is already a version in another language and we need the translation for that particular language.
