## If you would like to `write an article`

[Here you will find all the articles inside the repository](https://github.com/breatheco-de/content/tree/docs/src/content), some of them are:
- Published: already finished but you can still make small changes like fixing grammar errors.
- Draft: someone is already working on it but it's not finished yet.
- Unassigned: no one has picked that article or started working on it.
- Pending translation: there is already a version in another language and we need the translation for that particular language

### Writing a new article

Pick one of the `unasigned` or `pending_translation` articles from [this list](https://github.com/breatheco-de/content/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) and comment on the issue to start working on it.

Follow Github markdown syntax to write your article, we recommend using a text editor that supports markdown like stack edit.

We have also create some special icons and components that you can also use inside your article content:

#### Syntax Highlighting

***For inline syntax Highlighting***

Start your inline code with the language followed by the `>` character, for example:
```txt
python>print("hello")
```
Will look like this: `python>print("Hello")`

***Multiline syntax Highlighting***

Start your code with three tildes like this: `

Will look like this:

```html
<strong>Hello</strong>
<p></p>
```

***Adding Line Numbers***

To add line numbers just add `{numberLines: true}` after your language declaration like this:

```html{numberLines: true}

<p>This is some very big code</p>

<p>With lots of lines of code</p>

```
