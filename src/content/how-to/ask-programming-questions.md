When working remote, you have to pay lots of attention to the way you communicate your ideas, questions, etc.

Lets compare these two questions:
```md
1. Who can i add one item to an array?
2. I'm trying to add an item to an array in javascript, this is my code but its not working (screenshoot), what am I doing wrong?
```

If a mentor were to respond first question he/she would have to write the code from scratch (or google it) and past it in the chat. Without being able to test it propery if not in a desktop computer at that moment.

The second questions would be a lot easier to answer, it will take a minute to review the code, look for possible errors and give feedback.

## Steps to ask remote questions and feedback?

1. Use the slack channel instead of email, or anything else.
2. Take around 20 minutes to try and solve the problem yourself.
3. If you can solve it, prepare the questions saying what you have tried.
4. Take a screenshot of your code (and the console if possible), copying and pasting is a bad idea because the code will loose format.
5. If its a really complicated code, maybe its better to record your questions using [Loom (free)](https://www.loom.com/), it will take you just 2 minutes.

Belive me when I tell you that follwing these steps you will get straigh answers in a matter of minutes instead of having to iterate back and forth.
