# How to Update Python on Windows

Need to update to your current Python version on Windows and don't know where to start? Don't worry, the following article will explain step by step how you can update to the version of Python you want.

Currently, there is no "automatic" way to do it, to perform the update we must do it "manually" by going to the official Python website to start. Let's see step by step how to perform this update:

## How to Update Python on Windows (Download from Website)

1. **Checking the installed Python Version** | To start, we recommend checking or making sure which version of Python you currently have installed. You can do this in several ways, you can open a Windows PowerShell window or you can also use the command prompt, in both cases you will have to type  `python --version`, hit enter and you will be able to see the version of Python that you currently have installed. Let's see an example using the command prompt:

2. **Go to the Official Python Website** | You can use Google and type **Download Python** or you can just use the following link to go to the [Python Download Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once you are on the website, you just need to click the yellow button where it says **"Download the latest version for windows"** as shown below:

4. **Uninstall the Older Python Version** | You can now close the installation window. If you search "Python" in the Windows Search Bar, you'll see that we still have 2 Python versions (old and new). To finish the update, you'll have to uninstall the older Python version, you can do this by typing "Python" in the Windows Search Bar, selecting the older version, and clicking the uninstall button as follows:

5. **Confirm that Python is Updated ** | You can open a Windows PowerShell window or use the command prompt again to confirm the Python version installed and check if it was updated by typing `python --version` as we did in step 1:
