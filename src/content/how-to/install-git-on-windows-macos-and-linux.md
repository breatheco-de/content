## Verifying the GIT Installation

After installing Git, verify that it is installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```sh
git --version
```

You should see the installed Git version number.

## Git vs Github

Git and GitHub are very different things: The first one is a free and open-source technology to track your project changes, and the second one is a for-profit company that uses Git (like many other companies like Gitlab and Bitbucket). Nevertheless, we strongly recommend you understand [what is Github](/lesson/welcome-to-github) and [how to build your coding reputation](/lesson/building-your-github-profile-and-reputation) on it because it will help you a lot throughout your career.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you should have Git installed on your computer, regardless of the operating system. Configuring your Git user information ensures that your commits are attributed to you correctly. With Git set up, you can start managing your projects more efficiently and collaborate with others seamlessly.
