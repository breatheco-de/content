# Welcome to GitHub

This lesson will define Github.com, explain it, and review its essential features. Hopefully, by the end of the article, you will be as excited as we are about Github.

## What is GitHub

GitHub.com is the epicenter of your software developer journey; you'll be interacting with GitHub so much that we cannot even list all the things you can do; here are a few examples:

- GitHub is where you save your code every night: Like a hard drive.
- It's your professional portfolio: Like a resume.
- It's the technology needed to collaborate with other developers.
- Your GitHub profile is reviewed by recruiters when considering hiring you.
- You can also meet other developers and cool projects or libraries: Like Linked in.

> Github is `LinkedIn + Google Drive` but for developers.

## Your GitHub Profile

This is [4Geeks Academy's main GitHub profile](https://github.com/4geeksacademy/) on Github (Please click to follow us 🙂 on the top right of the page!).

Everyone has a profile located at: `https://github.com/<your username>`. 
For example: mine is [github.com/alesanchezr](https://github.com/alesanchezr) (follow me 🙂!)

In this image, you will find the essential parts of your profile.

## The GitHub Repository?

Github's original purpose (before turning into a social network and many other things) was to be a website where developers could upload their code and access it at any time.

> A repository is just a folder with code inside. For example, this repository contains [all the code for the React.js library](https://github.com/facebook/react).

Above you can see explanation of the typical Github Repository Page

Everything in Github revolves around code repositories:

1. You can create new repositories for every project you start, and upload your code into that repo.
2. Share the repo with everyone, people 👍🏼 like it, 📣 comment on it, open tickets about bug fixes, ask new features, etc.
3. Give access to other developers to edit your code inside your repository.
4. Any stranger can download your code, make changes and propose the changes for your approval.
5. Many other fabulous things you will discover.

### Liking and bookmarking a repository

The Github Star ⭐️ is the primary way to bookmark other people's repositories; it is a good idea to bookmark a repo because you will probably lose track of it; there are millions of amazing repos. You can categorize them.

We recommend you bookmark most of the academy repositories as you will need and use them a lot. Here is a few of them:

- [The main academy repository](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/About-4Geeks-Academy).
- [All the interactive tutorials](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/Interactive-Tutorials).
- [All the templates and boilerplates](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/Templates-Boilerplates).

### Finding other people's code

Open Source has become one of the main drivers in today's world; Github has ways to find other people's exceptional repositories:

- There is a search on the top navbar.
- You can search for tags or technologies.
- There is a feed of activity, and you can see what other devs you follow are doing.
- Some people curate repos: Here's an [awesome list or repos](https://github.com/topics/awesome).
- You can also see trending repos and recommendations in the feed.
