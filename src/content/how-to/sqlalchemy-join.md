# SQLAlchemy JOIN

To perform a basic **`join`** using **SQLAlchemy/Flask** and **Python**, you need to write your query as follows:

```py
results = db.session.query(table1, table2).join(table2).all()
```
This will perform an **`INNER JOIN`** using both tables. If you are wondering what is an **`INNER JOIN`**? You can read more about of what a **`join`** is and several **`join`** methods using **SQLAlchemy/Flask** and **Python** in the following section.

## SQLAlchemy JOIN Fundamentals

Throughout our development process, we will find ourselves with the need to consult information belonging to different tables of a database. Something very useful for this is the union of tables to make the consultation of any required information much easier. Here is where the **`JOIN`** clause comes into action. Before understanding how to work with Python and SQLAlchemy Joins, let's explain the definition of a **`JOIN`** in SQL.  

An **SQL `JOIN`** clause is used to join rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them (key fields).  You can read more about the definition of a **`JOIN`** here https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp.

Let's see a basic example of a common **`JOIN`** between two tables, **Clients** and **Orders**, as follows:

 - **Clients**

| client_id | name             | phone        |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
|  01       | Bryan Owens      | 123 123 4567 |
|  02       | Mark White       | 123 987 6543 |
|  03       | Brandon Hughes   | 123 159 1591 |
|  04       | Sheryl Lohan     | 123 456 4567 |

 - **Orders**

| order_id | client_id | invoice |
|----------|-----------|---------|
|  111     | 03        | 654     |
|  222     | 01        | 159     |
|  333     | 01        | 901     |
|  444     | 04        | 778     |

Let's order only the clients that have a pending order using the next **SQL sequence**:

```sql
SELECT Clients.name, Orders.order_id FROM Clients
INNER JOIN Orders ON Clients.client_id=Orders.order_id
ORDER BY Clients.name;
```

If there are **clients** that do not have a match with an **order**, these clients won't show on the results. The previous code will give us the next results:

| name             | order_id |
|------------------|----------|
| Brandon Hughes   | 111      |
| Bryan Owens      | 222      |
| Bryan Owens      | 333      |
| Sheryl Lohan     | 444      |

See that ***Brian Owens*** appears two times in the results since he has two pending orders (**222** and **333**). ***Mark White*** does not appear since there is no pending order made by him.

The **`JOIN`** that we just did is called **`INNER JOIN`** and it's the most common **`JOIN`** in SQL. The **`INNER JOIN`** selects all rows of both tables as long as there is a match between the columns in both tables. The basic syntax of the **`INNER JOIN`** is the following:

```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2...
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_field = table2.common_field;
```

Now that we know what a **`JOIN`** clause is in SQL, we can move on to exploring how to work with JOINs using SQLAlchemy, Flask, and Python.

## SQLAlchemy JOIN Using Flask and Python

The next example will explain how to work with the **`JOIN`** clause using **SQLAlchemy/Flask** and **Python**, but this example is perfectly adaptable to just SQLAlchemy and Python if desired. Let's work with the tables from the previous example, we proceed to create the models/tables using SQLAlchemy/Flask and Python as follows:

```py
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Client(db.Model):
	client_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	name = db.Column(db.String(50))
	phone = db.Column(db.Integer)

class Order(db.Model):
	order_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	client_id = db.Column(db.String(50), db.ForeignKey('clients.client_id')
	invoice = db.Column(db.Integer)
```

With the models/tables ready, we proceed to write our query (syntax) as follows:

```py
results = db.session.query(table1, table2).join(table2).all()
```

Following this syntax, let's now join the **Client** table with the **Order** table as follows:

```py
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Client(db.Model):
	client_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	name = db.Column(db.String(50))
	phone = db.Column(db.Integer)

class Order(db.Model):
	order_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	client_id = db.Column(db.String(50), db.ForeignKey('clients.client_id')
	invoice = db.Column(db.Integer)

results = db.session.query(Client, Order).join(Order).all()

#Printing the results:
for client, order in results:
	print(client.name, order.order_id)
```

After printing the results and running the code in a bash terminal we get:

```code
Brandon Hughes 111
Bryan Owens 222
Bryan Owens 333
Sheryl Loan 444
```

**`INNER JOIN`** is not the only way that we can combine tables, sometimes we might want to receive information from matched and unmatched rows from one of the tables or both, the **`JOIN`** that will help us on getting also unmatching information is called  **`OUTER JOIN`**

## SQLAlchemy OUTER JOIN Using Flask and Python

There are multiple types of **`OUTER JOINs`**, and depending on which table or tables we want to extract information from, we will decide which **`OUTER JOIN`** will be the best choice. There are 3 types of **`OUTER JOINs`**:

 ### LEFT OUTER JOIN:
 Unlike an **`INNER JOIN`**, where we only look for matching rows in both tables, a **`LEFT JOIN`** will give priority to the table on the left, giving us all of its rows, and will still look for matching rows on the right table. In other words, we'll get all the information from the left table and **only the matching information** from the right table.

![LEFT OUTER JOIN example](https://www.w3resource.com/sql/joins/joins-output/sql-left-jon.png)

Let's use the same tables used in the **SQLAlchemy/Flask** and **Python** **`INNER JOIN`** example previously:

```py
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Client(db.Model):
	client_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	name = db.Column(db.String(50))
	phone = db.Column(db.Integer)

class Order(db.Model):
	order_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	client_id = db.Column(db.String(50), db.ForeignKey('clients.client_id')
	invoice = db.Column(db.Integer)
```

Now, in our query, instead of writing the word `join`, we need to write the word `outerjoin` which by default is a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` in SQLAlchemy:

 - **`INNER JOIN`** query:

```py
results = db.session.query(table1, table2).join(table2).all()
```

- **`LEFT OUTER JOIN`** query:

```py
results = db.session.query(table1, table2).outerjoin(table2).all()
```

We then proceed to write our query and print the results as follows:

```py
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Client(db.Model):
	client_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	name = db.Column(db.String(50))
	phone = db.Column(db.Integer)

class Order(db.Model):
	order_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	client_id = db.Column(db.String(50), db.ForeignKey('clients.client_id')
	invoice = db.Column(db.Integer)

results = db.session.query(Client, Order).outerjoin(Order).all()

#Printing the results:
for client, order in results:
	print(client.name, order.order_id)
```

After printing the results and running the code in a bash terminal we get:

```code
Brandon Hughes 111
Bryan Owens 222
Bryan Owens 333
Sheryl Loan 444
Mark White  Null
```

See that now ***Mark White*** appears on the results with no order, in this way we have all the information from the left table plus the matching information from the right table.

### RIGHT OUTER JOIN:

A **`RIGHT JOIN`** will give priority to the table on the right, giving us all of its rows, and will still look for matching rows on the left table. In other words, weâ€™ll get all the information from the right table and **only the matching information** from the left one.

![RIGHT JOIN example](https://www.w3resource.com/sql/joins/joins-output/sql-right-jon.gif)

For the next example, let's add an order that for some reason does not have a client assigned to it, so the tables should look like this:

 - **Clients**

| client_id | name             | phone        |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
|  01       | Bryan Owens      | 123 123 4567 |
|  02       | Mark White       | 123 987 6543 |
|  03       | Brandon Hughes   | 123 159 1591 |
|  04       | Sheryl Lohan     | 123 456 4567 |


 - **Orders**

| order_id | client_id | invoice |
|----------|-----------|---------|
|  111     | 03        | 654     |
|  222     | 01        | 159     |
|  333     | 01        | 901     |
|  444     | 04        | 778     |
|  555     | 05        | 001     |

Using these tables in **SQLAlchemy/Flask** and **Python** as follows:

```py
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Client(db.Model):
	client_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	name = db.Column(db.String(50))
	phone = db.Column(db.Integer)

class Order(db.Model):
	order_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	client_id = db.Column(db.String(50), db.ForeignKey('clients.client_id')
	invoice = db.Column(db.Integer)
```

There is no word in SQLAlchemy that allows us to perform a `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` since the `outerjoin` word refers to a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` by default.  If we want to perform a `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`, we just need to flip the order of our tables, in other words, **`Table 1 RIGHT OUTER JOIN Table 2`** is equivalent of **`Table 2 LEFT OUTER JOIN Table 1`**, so the query should look like this:

```py
results = db.session.query(table2, table1).outerjoin(table1).all()
```
We then proceed to write our query and print the results as follows:

```py
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Client(db.Model):
	client_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	name = db.Column(db.String(50))
	phone = db.Column(db.Integer)

class Order(db.Model):
	order_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	client_id = db.Column(db.String(50), db.ForeignKey('clients.client_id')
	invoice = db.Column(db.Integer)

results = db.session.query(Order, Client).outerjoin(Client).all()

#Printing the results:
for client, order in results:
	print(client.name, order.order_id)
```

After printing the results and running the code in a bash terminal we get:

```code
Brandon Hughes 111
Bryan Owens 222
Bryan Owens 333
Sheryl Loan 444
NULL		555
```
See that now Order ***555*** appears on the results with no client assigned to it, in this way we have all the information from the right table plus the matching information from the left table.

### FULL OUTER JOIN:
An **`OUTER JOIN`** or **`FULL OUTER JOIN`** will combine the results of a `LEFT JOIN` and a `RIGHT JOIN`, giving us all the rows from the first and second tables. If there is no match in one of the table rows, there will be a `NULL` on that side of the table's result.

![FULL OUTER JOIN example](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS_axXDbw-j6BMEu9DwjZyiAMGzG-g0DMkKI9MaPB7uQbf7_4TbLObZKK3IajH2fUDFlcU&usqp=CAU)

There is no word in SQLAlchemy that allows us to perform a `FULL OUTER JOIN` since the `outerjoin` word refers to a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` by default. If we want to perform a `FULL OUTER JOIN`, we just need to add `full=True` statement in our query as follows:

```py
results = db.session.query(table2, table1).outerjoin(table1, full=True).all()
```
We then proceed to write our query and print the results as follows:
```py
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Client(db.Model):
	client_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	name = db.Column(db.String(50))
	phone = db.Column(db.Integer)

class Order(db.Model):
	order_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	client_id = db.Column(db.String(50), db.ForeignKey('clients.client_id')
	invoice = db.Column(db.Integer)

results = db.session.query(Order, Client).outerjoin(Client, full=True).all()

#Printing the results:
for client, order in results:
	print(client.name, order.order_id)
```

After printing the results and running the code in a bash terminal we get:

```code
Brandon Hughes 111
Bryan Owens 222
Bryan Owens 333
Sheryl Loan 444
NULL		555
Mark White  NULL
```

As mentioned before, we see that we get all the information from both tables including the unmatched results from table 1 and table 2.
