If you're learning at 4Geeks, whether it's Full Stack, Cybersecurity, Vibe Coding, AI, or any other program, you should consider learning in public. This is not just a theory, it's a proven strategy for faster learning and career growth.

In this article, we'll explain why it works and how to get started.

## What is Learn In Public?

**Learning in private** is what most of us are used to: reading, attending class, completing assignments, and quietly leveling up until graduation.

**Learning in public** means sharing your progress openly. That could be:

- Posting on social media
- Writing short updates or articles
- Sharing code or projects on GitHub
- Creating videos, drawings, or even memes about what you’re learning
- Commenting and engaging in forums and communities

## Why is this so important?

- Writing and teaching reinforce your learning.
- You develop stronger communication and reasoning skills.
- Friends, family, and peers start seeing you as “the go-to person” in tech.
- You’ll build confidence and battle impostor syndrome by finding others on the same journey.
- Platforms like LinkedIn will boost your visibility when you publish often.
- Recruiters and employers will notice you—at 4Geeks, we've seen students land jobs just from posting about their progress.
- You’ll avoid feeling isolated. On Twitter/X, thousands of people are learning and sharing every day—especially under hashtags like `#100DaysOfCode`, `#BuildInPublic`, and `#LearnToCode`. These are active, welcoming communities where you’ll find support, ideas, and encouragement.

## How to start learning in public

- Create or polish your profiles on LinkedIn (strongly recommended), Twitter/X, Instagram, Reddit, etc.
- Make your profiles reflect who you are as a developer, cybersecurity analyst, AI builder, or creative technologist.
- Every time you complete a project or module, share it! Write a short post or create a video about what you did and what you learned.
  - [Here’s an example from a 4Geeks student](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6750086679345815552/)
- Join public challenges like [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) — perfect if you're learning to code.
- For other disciplines, try using hashtags like:
  - `#LearnCybersecurity`
  - `#AIDailyLearn`
  - `#TechCreatives`
  - `#PromptEngineering`
  - `#VibeCoding`
- Follow communities on Twitter/X where engineers, hackers, and learners regularly post deep technical threads—especially in topics like Redis, PostgreSQL, AI, and web architecture.
  - Some Redis threads are so detailed they’re better than documentation—follow accounts like @antirez (Redis creator), @gliderlabs, or explore `#Redis` and `#DatabaseTips`.
- Start a YouTube channel or a blog. Talk about what you’re learning week by week—people love real, authentic journeys.
- Contribute to open source: even a small documentation fix is a great way to learn and be seen.
- Attend meetups and online events. Talk to other learners and professionals—you’ll be amazed at the doors that open.

## Common thoughts that hold people back

### “I don’t have anything to say.”

You do. Learning to code (or break into tech in any area) is hard. Your story helps others who feel stuck or alone. Just by showing up and sharing what you're doing, you're adding value.

### “I’m not an expert.”

Nobody starts as an expert. Even senior developers constantly learn new things. Sharing your beginner perspective is actually incredibly helpful to other beginners.

### “I don’t have time.”

You're already taking notes, completing projects, and reflecting on what you learn. Turn some of that into public posts—just one update a week can make a big difference.
