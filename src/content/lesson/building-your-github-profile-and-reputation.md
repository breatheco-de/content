## Introduction to Github (skip it if you know it already)

![Github Screenshot](../../assets/images/4889ebd9-201f-46c7-a1fb-d3d8c2f4493e.png)

Github is a social network for developers, but probably not the type of social network you use every day:
- You can't post a picture of what you are about to eat.
- You post text documents on any format (txt, html, css, xls, png, jpeg, etc.).
- You can't post status messages like on Twitter, Instagram, etc.
- You have to use a special program and protocol called [GIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY).
- It cannot be faked and it tracks your activity as a developer.

## Why Github matters for recruiters 

Github is now the developers #1 portfolio, the best way to get noticed and build a professional brand. You need to make a huge effort on making it:  
    
   1. Easy to browse by a potential employer.  
   2. Easy to understand and fast to read.  
   3. Amazing look (you never have a 2nd time to give the first impression).  

## Making Your Github Profile Shine

Make sure to give your own personal style, but in general you can focus on trying to comply with the following guidelines:

- [ ] Write a short bio with your main focus as a developer and special skills.
- [ ] On your profile page, include links to your personal website, Linkedin profile, email and social media handle, if relevant.
- [ ] Add a picture or avatar.
- [ ] Start committing and pushing from day one: Github tracks and publicly reports your activity as a developer in something called [The Github Activity Graph](https://help.github.com/en/articles/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile#contributions-calendar) it's impossible to fake. That is why we encourage you to start committing and collaborating since day one.
- [ ] For each repository your want to pin and promote you upload must include:  
    1. A detailed README.md
    2. Live demo (Github pages), screenshots, and gifs.
    3. Very organized, clean code and comments.
- [ ] Your most important project, the one you are proud the most, must be pinned on the first slot.
- [ ] Contribute to at least 5 external projects. Find open-source projects you like and make contributions. In the following links you'll find projects and indications on how to contribute:  
    - https://www.firsttimersonly.com/
    - http://yourfirstpr.github.io/
    - https://www.codetriage.com/
    - https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners
- [ ] You need to be a [github developer program](https://developer.github.com/program/) member. You can join for free and you will get a badge on your profile.
- [ ] Avoid using  "new developer", "junior developer", "recent graduate", or the like in your summary statement or bio.
