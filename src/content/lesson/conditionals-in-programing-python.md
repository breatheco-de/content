## Introduction to conditionals in Python

There are 5 skills you need to master in your tool set for building algorithms with Python:

1. Variables.
2. Conditionals.
3. Lists (or arrays).
4. Loops.
5. Functions.

The use of *conditionals* is the easiest way we have to make decisions when coding our algorithms.

Let's say we are building a program to help us pick what to wear, but we hate the blue color. We could tell the computer to avoid that color using a statement like this:  

```python
if color == 'blue':
    # Do something
else:
    # Do something else or do nothing
```

## What is a logical expression in Python?

Logical expressions let you conditionally skip a series of lines of your code.
The best way to understand them is to think of them like questions you can ask the computer about your variables, for example:

1. `if user_age > 21:`
2. `if day == "tuesday":`
3. `if car_model == "toyota" and number_of_tires == 6:`

In order to ask a question or conditionally excuse a particular set of lines, you first need to have data (information) stored on useful variables. Above we had the variables `user_age`, `day`, `car_model` and `number_of_tires`.

If we don't have the information prestored in variables we are not able to ask any questions, it is all about strategy and planning!

For example, if we have the user's age stored in a variable `age` then, and only then, we are able to code for something like:

```python
# We use two equal signs (==) when we want to compare two variables for equality
if age == 21:
    print("You are old enough!")
```

## What type of conditions/questions can we use/ask?

The previous example was a simple condition, but in real life, picking what to wear involves a combination of several conditions to make the final decision. For example: Let's look at this algorithm that tells you if you have the flu

![The flu algorithm](https://github.com/breatheco-de/content/blob/master/src/assets/images/03ed6b76-0ee0-4b04-bd45-0fb58ae6f800.jpeg?raw=true)

If you want to represent this algorithm in Python, it will look something like this:

```python
feels_like_hit_by_train = True
you_were_hit_by_train = False

if feels_like_hit_by_train == True:
    if you_were_hit_by_train == True:
        print("You don't have the flu")
    else:
        print("You have the flu")
else:
    print("You don't have the flu")
```

Basically, this algorithm has two variables to consider: `feels_like_hit_by_train` and `you_were_hit_by_train`.
Our job as developers is to sit down and try to prepare a strategy and come up with an algorithm that solves a problem.

## Logical Operators in Python

Mostly all the questions can be asked using the following comparisons: `==`, `>`, `<`, `!=`, ` is None`, ` is not None`, `in`:

| Operator      | Example       | Description  |
| ----          | ----          | --------  |
| `==`          | `if a == b`   | if the value of variable `a` is **equal** to the value of `b`   |
| `<`           | `if a < b`    | if the value of variable `a` is **less** than the value of `b`   |
| `>`           | `if a > b`    | if the value of variable `a` is **greater** than the value of `b`   |
| `!=`          | `if a != b`   | if the value of variable `a` is **different** from the value of `b` |
| `is not None` | `if a is not None`    | This is self-explanatory, isn't it?   |
| `is None`     | `if a is None`    | This is self-explanatory, isn't it?   |
| `in`          | `if name in ['bob','maria','nancy']`  | If the value of `name` is contained inside the list of names   |

## `AND` & `OR` Operators in Python

Another way to write the algorithm is to combine questions in the same condition using the `AND` and `OR`:

```python
feels_like_hit_by_train = True
you_were_hit_by_train = False

if feels_like_hit_by_train and you_were_hit_by_train:
    print("You don't have the flu")
elif feels_like_hit_by_train:
    print("You have the flu")
```

As you can see we are using `elif` together for the first time, for faster coding. Another trick you can use for faster coding:

| Original | Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| instead of `if(feels_like_hit_by_train == true)` | you write `if feels_like_hit_by_train`  |
| instead of `if(you_were_hit_by_train == false)` | you write `if not you_were_hit_by_train` |

## If...else in Python

You can also use the `else` expression to refer to the negation of the first condition:

```python
if color == "blue":
    # Discard this clothing item
else:
    # Put it in your closet

age = 12
if age > 18:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are not an adult")
```

You can also nest several if...else conditions on top of one another, like this:

```python
if age < 16:
    # You cannot do anything
elif age < 18:
    # At this point, we know it's older than 15 because if not, it would have entered
    # into the first condition
elif age < 21:
    # If the algorithm enters here, we know it's older than 17
else:
    # If the algorithm enters here, we know it's older than 20
```

Here is another example that runs an algorithm to find out if a number is in the "hundreds".

```python
value = 14

if value < 10:
  print("single unit value")
elif value < 100:
  print("dozens")
elif value < 1000:
  print("hundreds")
elif value < 10000:
  print("thousands")
else:
  print("hundreds of thousands, or maybe more")
```

## The `switch` statement in Python

Python does not have a `switch` statement.

## Conclusion

It's all about what question to ask. The previous example was a simple condition, but real life is not that simple. There are lots of nested conditions and complicated flows that will challenge your skills to the limit. For example:

This will be the algorithm for picking what to wear on Valentine's Day:

![What to wear on valentine's day](https://github.com/breatheco-de/content/blob/master/src/assets/images/87f2be86-32c3-4bfc-8db4-dbd0d979e4d3.jpeg?raw=true)

```python
if going_out:
    if can_I_get_burger:
        if place_bottle_wine:
            if cool_mix:
                # Do something
    else:
        if blazers > 3:
            # Do something
        else:
            # Do something
    elif she_pants:
        # Do something
    else:
        # Do something
else:
    if naked_she_door:
        # Do something
    elif blazers > 3:
        # Do something
    else:
        # Do something
```
