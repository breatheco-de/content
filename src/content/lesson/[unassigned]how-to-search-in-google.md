There

1. Always add the programing language at the end: This is simple, any question you ask on google has to have the programming language at the end: `How to bla bla bla javascript` or `How to bla bla bla python`.

2. Remove things that only apply to you: If you are adding people into an array, that is probably to specific, what you are really adding is probaly strings into the array.  

3. Beware using the framework as a keyword: If you search `how to add a new task to array in react` 

4. Pick your words very wisely: Your goal is to get right to the answer, if you really know what you are doing you can be more specific on your word selection:

| Bad choice of words           | Good choice of words              | Explanation |
| ---------------------------   | --------------------------- |
| How to add a student to an array | append item array js | You are too specific, all you care is about how to add an item, if the item is a string that represents the student name that only matters to you |
| How to get 10 random colors | get random color js | Adding 10 colors is adding one color 10 times, better to be less specific and we can always do it 10 times later |
| how to add a new task to array in react | add item to array in js |

4. Use familiar sites: W3Schools, Stack Overflow, Mozilla MDN, Medium Posts, DevTo, Github and Discourse Forums.

5. ## When using StackOverflow

- Stack overflow will starts with someone asking a question, check if the question is similar to yours.
- Read some of the main answers and pick the answer you feel will help you the most.
- Read the answer first: Do no't just copy and past the answer, it will NEVER work as it is writen.
