# **HTML is the Website Skeleton**
***

All web pages have HTML – it’s the structure of EVERYTHING.  Think of it as building columns at a construction site.

HTML makes you divide the website information into parts – similar to the basic parts of a document: header, title, content, footnote, subtitle, etc.  Then, with CSS, you can make your page beautiful, and, with JavaScript, make it interactive.

Originally browsers only knew how to interpret HTML.  Websites were simple and neither CSS or JavaScript was used.  A website was a simple plain text document with the typical elements any Word Document has: Headings, Bullet lists, Paragraphs, etc.

# **HTML Syntax: It’s All `<Tags>`.**
***
![what is html](https://ucarecdn.com/78296f64-547f-4928-a8da-14cb24e836b9/)

Remember how we said that the Internet is all text?

In that sense, HTML is a language that uses `<tags>` to represent the elements that the web page must include.  A tag is just a word that begins and ends with the `<` and `>` characters, respectively.



All tags must open and close.  To close a tag you must place the same word but using the `/` symbol.

# **Attributes**
***
Once the `<tag>` is defined, we can describe in detail its behavior by assigning attributes to those `<tags>`.  For example, if we want our HTML document/page to have a link to another page, we use the `<a>` tag, and we assign to it an attribute called **href**, which allows us to specify the URL of the page with which we want to have a connection.

```html
<a href="google.com">Click here and it will take you to Google.com</a>
```


In theory, you have to use [one of this tags](https://breatheco.de/en/lesson-asset/html5-cheat-sheet/), don’t invent your own because the browser won’t know how to interpret them.  You must **learn HTML** tag meanings and their functionality, in order to put them to good use…but, please, don’t worry!   There aren’t that many! 🙂

For the main heading of the document, the tag that we use is `<h1>`.  For example: An online store has an "electronics" category, the title that applies would be "Electronics" and the `<h1>` tag would be written as follows:

```html
 <h1>Electronic items</h1>
```


##### **Nested Tags** :
Finally, tags can contain one or more tags within them.  For example, if we would like to give a cursive style to the word "electronic" we must wrap that word with the tag `<i>`:

```html
 <h1><i>Electronic</i> Tags</h1>
```

 ## Blank Spaces and Line Jumps 
 ***
 The browser ignores blank spaces and end of lines.  If we want to jump one line, we have to use the `<br>` tag.  If we want more "spaces" we need to insert one `&nbsp;` per each blank space (yes, we know it’s weird, but it is what it is).

**These three alternatives will look the same (spaces and jumps of line will be ignored):**
```html
<tag>Hello</tag><tag>World</tag>
```
```html
<tag>Hello</tag>
<tag>World</tag>
```

```html
<tag>Hello</tag>               <tag>World</tag>
```


# **Page Structure**
***
All pages must begin with the `<DOCTYPE! Html>` statement, then the `<HEAD>` and the `<BODY>` should follow.  These tags **must** contain other tags within them (nested tags) because they will split the page in 2 main parts: the HEAD and the BODY:


```html
<! –- We must always begin with an HTML label to show the browser that this is a document with an HTML format. — >
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
   <! — Inside the head tag we will define all that the browser needs BEFORE it begins to interpret the page. –>
   </head>
   <body>
   <!–Inside the body we will define the real content of the page.–>
   </body>
</html>
```

Lets simulate how a browser thinks: Imagine a user on his browser (client side) that types the URL: breatheco.de

+ The server will open the default HTML file on that server, which will probably be: index.html.
+ Then, it will read its content and interpret it as HTML (because the extension of the file is index.html).
+ The user will not see the text content of the file, instead it will view a visual interpretation of that text.
  
  As you can see, the page in question will include AT LEAST the following tags:

  ![learn html](https://ucarecdn.com/e8d3d49d-8c7e-4bc2-88e0-15b95a8ccc54/-/resize/400x/)

|**Name**   |**Tags**   |**Description**   |
|:----------|:----------|:-----------------|
|HTML       |`<html>`   |We must begin by letting the browser know that this is an HTML document.  We can also specify the HTML version that we are using.   |
|Head       |`<head>`   |Everything that is written inside of the HEAD won’t be seen by the user.  It’s the part of the page where the developer specifies information about the website itself: the language being used, what the website is about, the necessary fonts, the icon that the tab will have on the browser (favicon), and many other important things.   |
|Body       |`<body>`   |Here you will place all the content that will be viewed by the end user.<br>If this were MS Word, the body would mark the beginning of your page content (the first line of your document).   | 

# **The \<HEAD\> is like the Envelope of a Letter.**
***
We read the envelope of a letter to find out information of the letter itself, but not of its content.  Here you can find out who wrote the letter, in what language is it written, where is it from, etc.

In the case of HTML, the `<head>` can contain the following tags (among less important ones):

|**Name**   |**Tag**   |**Description**   |
|:----------|:---------|:-----------------|
|Title   |`<title>`   |The title appears in the browser’s window, it’s also used when you share the page through social media: Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.  All those networks use the title of the page as the excerpt when a user copies the URL of your page to share on their wall.   |
|Meta   |`<meta>`   |The meta tags describe a document.  They are used to specify things like: the author, title, date, keywords, descriptions, etc.   Search engines love these tags because they allow an easier comprehension of the content before it is read.   |
|Link   |`<link>`   |Used for linking the page with the CSS style sheets.  In the CSS chapter we will learn how to create style sheets and we will be able to import them using this tag.   |
|Style   |`<style>`   |If we can’t or don’t want to import a CSS style sheet, we may also define styles directly on the HTML document inside this tag.  This is a practice that we rarely recommend and should only be used when you don’t have any other choice.   |
|Script   |`<script>`   |Used to add JavaScript code to the page.  All of the JavaScript code must be contained in these tags that can be used also in the BODY, if desired.  The difference is that any JavaScript code that we place in a style tag in the BODY won’t be available when the page begins to run (that’s exactly why the is HEAD is so useful).   |

# **The <body> is Similar to any MS Word Document**

Ok, now that we are familiar with the general and necessary structure of the page, lets review the tags we can and must use to define the content of the page.

Remember – for the fifteenth time – that a web page is…a text document!  That’s right, if you knew the answer before you read it you are getting it!  And, if not, don’t worry.  We’ve never known of anyone who learn HTML and CSS rather quickly ;).

Lets see how a website compares to a Word document:

<before-after width="500px" before="https://ucarecdn.com/f2021d8d-193d-4482-b189-ae0005b1bd88/" after="https://ucarecdn.com/8e339149-97ae-4b15-ba59-a3ddf3777525/" /></before-after>

The most frequent tags used inside the `<body>` of an HTML document are:

|**Name**   |**Tags**   |**Description**   |
|:----------|:----------|:-----------------|
| Head       |H1, H2, H3, etc.   |This defines the headings and subheadings of the page (the heading is not the same as the title; the title is used by the browser and it’s defined with the title tag).<br>`<h1>This is a heading</h1>`   |
|Parragraph   |P   |This tag separates the text content with an upper and lower margin.  It simulates the behavior of a Word document.`<p>example of a paragraph</p>`   |
|List   |UL, OL   |Lists are of huge importance in a document as they are widely used.  With HTML we have two main tags to list any content items:<br><br> <li>OL: List with numbers (numbers at the beginning of the item)</li><br><li>UL: List without numbers (bullets in front of the items).<br><br>`<ol>`<br>`<li>Element 1</li>`<br>`<li>Element 2</li>`<br>`</ol>`   |
|Image  |img   |It allow us to add images to the document (they could be PNG, JPEG, GIF and SVG, basically) .<br>`<img src="url of the image"/>`
|Link (Anchor)   |a   |Sometimes we want to connect one or more pages with another one, or send the user to a new page, or even send the user to another section within the same page (just as with the Menu of this course).  That’s what the "Anchor" tag is made for.<br>`<a href="url to resend">this is a heading</a>`   |
|Bold   |strong o b   |To highlight a text using bold.<br>`<strong>this is a heading</strong>`   |
|Italics   |i   |To have the text in italics.<br>`<i>this is a heading</i>`   |
|Line jump   |br   |To jump or skip the text to the line (similar to a `shift+enter` in MS Word.)<br>`<br></br>`   |
|Tables   |table   |Tables were designed to present data in a more read-friendly and coherent way.  It has a header (th), row (tr) and columns (td).<br><br>`<table>`<br>`<tr><th>Column 1</th><th>Column 2</th></tr>`<br>`<tr><td>Data 1</td><td>Data A</td></tr>`<br>`<tr><td>Data 2</td><td>Data B</td></tr><br>`<br>`<tr><td>Data 3</td><td>Data C</td></tr>`<br>`</table>`   |

# **The Attributes (Properties)**
***
We already know each `<tag>` behavior.  Thanks to the tags, we can change the letter size – like in the case of the headings – and add margins between paragraphs, number elements, etc.

If you wish to further specify how the behavior of a specific tag should be, you can use its attributes.  To place them, you must write the corresponding attribute in the opening tag, like this:
```html
<img src="http://www.mydomain.com/myimage.png" \>
```

In this case, we are assigning the "src" property to the `<img>` tag which will indicate the path of the image to be displayed in this container.

Each tag has its own properties – you do not have to memorize them, you will always find them quickly over the Internet – but, it is good that you know the most important ones so that you have them ready in your mind at any time.

That’s why we have created a series of exercises that will better explain each of the important properties of the most used HTML elements.

## Clap, Clap, Clap.  You had learn HTML!!! 
***
We are so PROUD!!! 🙂

You just learned how a website was built in 1999.  Now we only have a few more weeks to catch up on everything else during the latest 20 years.

HTML has a lot more tags.  It also has a new version called HTML5.  Again, don’t worry, you’ll **learn HTML** and how to build beautiful (thanks to CSS) and interacting (thanks to formularies and JavaScript) websites in the next few lessons.  That’s why we are here!!
